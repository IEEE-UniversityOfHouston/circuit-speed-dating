## Naming Conventions
promotional and depreciated materials should have `SEMESTER-TOPIC-VERSION` please. Topic can be something like a video, skit, flyer, etc. You can reach out to Project Chair(s) for doubts.

edu-materials and kicad files should have `CIRCUIT`. ... I think that should be it. If an IC is included, it should include the name of the IC.
